1. The Paleo Diet</font></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial">
<h3>The paleo diet claims that you should eat the same foods that your hunter-gatherer ancestors ate before agriculture developed.<br><br>The theory is that most modern diseases can be linked to the Western diet and the consumption of grains, dairy, and processed foods.<br><br>

While it’s debatable whether this diet really provides the same foods your ancestors ate, it is linked to several impressive health benefits.<br><br><br>

<u><font face="Arial Black" color="#0000FF">How it works</font></u>: The paleo diet emphasizes whole foods, lean protein, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds, while discouraging processed foods, sugar, dairy, and grains.<br><br>

Some more flexible versions of the paleo diet also allow for dairy like cheese and butter, as well as tubers like potatoes and sweet potatoes.<br><br><br>

<u><font face="Arial Black" color="#0000FF">Weight loss</font></u>: Several studies have shown that the paleo diet can lead to significant weight loss and reduced waist size <br><br>

</font><p><font size="12" face="Chiller">2. The Vegan Diet</font></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial">
<h3>The vegan diet restricts all animal products for ethical, environmental, or health reasons.<br><br><br>


<u><font face="Arial Black" color="#0000FF">How it works</font></u>: 
In addition to eliminating meat, it eliminates dairy, eggs, and animal-derived products, such as gelatin, honey, albumin, whey, casein, and some forms of vitamin D3.<br><br><br>

<u><font face="Arial Black" color="#0000FF">Weight loss</font></u>: 
A vegan diet seems to be very effective at helping people lose weight — often without counting calories — because its very low fat and high fiber content may make you feel fuller for longer.<br><br>

Vegan diets are consistently linked to lower body weight and body mass index (BMI) compared to other diets.<br><br>

One 18-week study showed that people on a vegan diet lost 9.3 pounds (4.2 kg) more than those on a control diet. The vegan group was allowed to eat until fullness, but the control group had to restrict calories.<br><br>

However, calorie for calorie, vegan diets are not more effective for weight loss than other diets<br><br>

</font><p><font size="12" face="Chiller">3. Atkins diet</font></p>
<pre>
<font size="4" face="Arial">
The Atkins diet is the most well-known low-carb weight loss diet.

Its proponents insist that you can lose weight by eating as much protein and fat as you like, as long as you avoid carbs.

The main reason why low-carb diets are so effective for weight loss is that they reduce your appetite.

This causes you to eat fewer calories without having to think about it 

<u><font face="Arial Black" color="#0000FF">How it works:</font></u>The Atkins diet is split into four phases. It starts with an induction phase, during which you eat under 20 grams of carbs per day for two weeks.

The other phases involve slowly reintroducing healthy carbs back into your diet as you approach your goal weight.

<u><font face="Arial Black" color="#0000FF">Weight loss:</font></u>The Atkins diet has been studied extensively and found to lead to faster weight loss than low-fat diets.
Other studies note that low-carb diets are very helpful for weight loss. They are especially successful in reducing belly fat, the most dangerous fat that lodges itself in your abdominal cavity
